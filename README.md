# Recreation: Stockholm 109 :books:

This is a recreation of the Stockholm website template number 109. 

This practice is part of several recreations that I have carried out in a course I am taking to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This particular practice has been done to work on :black_medium_square::black_medium_small_square::black_small_square: display grid	:black_small_square::black_medium_small_square::black_medium_square: and to start learning how to put different html pages together.
